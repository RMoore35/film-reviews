      <h2><b>About me</b></h2><br>
        <p>I obviously love movies and watch as many as I can. I love mixing it up and digging into genres
        that I haven't spent a lot of time in.</p>
        <p>I like to be active. I love any excuse to stop what I’m doing and go outside.</p>
        <p>I enjoy any form of exercise (mainly cycling, lifting, and running), reading, and playing guitar.</p>
        <p>I love good coffee with good friends.</p>
        <p>I love building and designing. Hence why I made this site completely from scratch!</p>
        <p>If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to head over to my contact page and I’ll get back with you as soon as I can.</p><br>
        <p>Cheers!</p><br>
