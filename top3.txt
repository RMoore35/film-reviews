<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-hunt-2012/' target='_blank'>The Hunt</a></h3><p>Viewers beware: this is not an easy or light watch. Mads Mikkelsen absolutely kills it as a somewhat lonely single man, who suddenly finds love and welcomes his son to live with him.  Thats all Ill reveal in the review, no spoilers here. But again, this isnt a light film, nor should it be. This tackles the subject matter with the poise it deserves, with stunning performances from Mads as well as the entire supporting cast. The script and cinematography lend themselves perfectly to the task at hand, delivering a well-crafted portrayal of love, friendship, and ruin.  Excellent.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/booksmart/' target='_blank'>Booksmart</a></h3><p>I know, I know. I should love this. And yes, the good parts are really good. But the bad parts are REALLY bad. I guess Ill round up to 3 stars, just to be fair.</p>
