<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/joint-security-area/' target='_blank'>Joint Security Area</a></h3><p>A gripping tale about an unlikely ally in a personal, inner war. A conflict and history that is much too complex for a feature film, but this makes a good attempt.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/hotel-mumbai/' target='_blank'>Hotel Mumbai</a></h3><p>A harrowing film about the incredibly sad true story. Considering there was already a documentary though, maybe we didnt need to live through this again? But maybe this brought knowledge to more people? Well probably never know, because the world is complex, and so you can form your own opinions.</p>
