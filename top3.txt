<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/earthquake-bird/' target='_blank'>Earthquake Bird</a></h3><p>I honestly thought this was excellent. I dont agree with the mixed reviews that tend to lean negative.  Vikander was phenomenal, as usual. The visuals were stunning and the story was captivating.  The only thing I will say is maybe some of the supporting roles were incorrectly casted? I dont know. I dont see the negative. Maybe I am too blinded by my never-ending praise for Vikander.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/burned/' target='_blank'>Burned</a></h3><p>Beautifully written, beautifully shot.  Really enjoyed this short. Maika Monroe is excellent. Need to see more Beau Knapp.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-fifth-estate/' target='_blank'>The Fifth Estate</a></h3><p>What did I just watch? Was this supposed to be a mockumentary? I am almost disgusted because this could have been an excellent film that also brought an incredible story to a wide audience in a compelling way. Instead, it did neither. Decent performances by Br√ºhl and Vikander are about all that brought this up to a star and a half. Oh, and I very much dislike Benedict Cumberbatch. In everything.</p>
