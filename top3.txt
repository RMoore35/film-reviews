<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/to-the-wonder/' target='_blank'>To the Wonder</a></h3><p>Terrence Malick took a chance on Ben Affleck starring in a real film and Ben let him down. Thats just the raw truth.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/sin-city/' target='_blank'>Sin City</a></h3><p>Sometimes you have no idea what youre walking into with a film and thats a good thing. Sin City is incredibly well-known. And yet somehow, despite being on my radar and watchlist for eons, I never took the time. I never read any reviews, watched any trailers, or knew anything about the layout. In the case of Sin City, thats perhaps the best way to take it in. Sin City invites the audience along for the ride, makes you question why you like certain things over others, and does a little dance along the way. You just sit back and trust that what youll find at the end is a feeling of joy that you just watched an incredible piece of art.</p>
