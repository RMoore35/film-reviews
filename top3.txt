<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/dog-skin/' target='_blank'>Dog Skin</a></h3><p>I believe this is the first horror-short I have ever watched. And it is a decent one. Being based on a fable is a decent starting point for a short-form work like this. I was drawn into the themes and the acting. But, the visuals need work. I look forward to seeing more from Tiago Teixeira.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/syriana/' target='_blank'>Syriana</a></h3><p>At times a thoughtful analysis, unfortunately this film falls flat like so many before it in. Perhaps this topic isnt fit for a feature length film? But it doesnt matter - movie studios worldwide will continue to exploit the topic for a quick buck.</p>

Annette Bening... OK, I have to crush. How? Im honestly not sure how she can be so good. She is going to have to be my next top-10 list. Now that Im past that, hm. Yes? Yes, I think this is great. Probably beyond great. Not sure I can squeeze it all into one review but Ill try. This starts with the appearance of a classic coming of age tale, that turns into so much more. First, I love the imagery. The house being remodeled is genius, the era choice is brilliant, and the soundtrack fits in nearly every scene. The story often feels stunted and disjointed, but that is one of the deliberate choices that makes this work so well. Fanning and Gerwig as "moms" is a choice that weaves intricately into the beautiful mosaic crafted by everyone involved. (cont.)...</p>
