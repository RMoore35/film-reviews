<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-pelican-brief/' target='_blank'>The Pelican Brief</a></h3><p>"Hey Ms. Shaw! You take my breath away!" I dont think I have seen many of the screen adaptations of Grishams novels. Id have to look back. This one is somewhere around middle of the road. The story is compelling, as is almost guaranteed by a film based on Grishams work. But beyond that, we dont see much of anything special. Both Roberts and Washington have had much stronger performances. And the shady figures who follow them around the whole film are, what, overdone? Even Sam Shepard and Stanley Tucci, who have minor roles in the first half, are too subtle, and not in a good way.  Maybe I should read the book? I need to do something to get over this let-down.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/good-morning-vietnam/' target='_blank'>Good Morning, Vietnam</a></h3><p>"Flip em the bird!" If you can get past the obvious faults and the not-made-for-2021 nature, this is Robin Williams and Forest Whitaker in excellent form.  Some times I think Whitaker gets a bad rap for over-acting - "cough" Battlefield Earth - "cough", but in this, he is the perfect yin to Williams yang. Their characters play off of each other superbly.  Add to the fine acting the on-location shoot and some classic military humor, and you have a film that finds an excellent spot in 1987. To think, Full Metal Jacket and this in the same year?! ** My 100th film I have watched this year!</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/blue-steel-1990/' target='_blank'>Blue Steel</a></h3><p>This review may contain spoilers. OK, lets try a little bit of a longer form review here: Jamie Lee Curtis: yes. One of the original Bad Asses. Have loved her in all of the Halloween films, and not sure why she hasnt done more films recently. By choice? Or has she had trouble getting roles? I dont know and I only really care if she hasnt been cast. If its her choice, good on her. Blue Steel was filmed before Heat. Now that I have seen this, I feel like I can appreciate both of them even more.  This was directed by Kathryn Bigelow, so I have to give praise there. Blue Steel starts off with Curtis catching a burglar in the act (Tom Sizemore, who I loved in Heat) and having to shoot him when he levels his gun at her. Curtis then empties all six rounds of her revolver into him, while noting that his gun is a .44 magnum. Just go with it. Its a bit of a stretch that none of the witnesses remember him having a gun (which couldnt be found because some psycho grabbed it) but whatever Ill role with it since it fits the story. The rest of the movie is essentially the psycho praying on Curtis. The psycho by the way is played by Ron Silver and pretty phenomenally at that. Curtis partner is Clancy Brown, of The Shawshank Redemption fame, who played a decent supporting role in this. I didnt really like how quickly Brown started to believe her. If it took so little convincing, why didnt he just believe her in the beginning? (cont.)...</p>
