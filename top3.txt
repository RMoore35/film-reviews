<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/takers/' target='_blank'>Takers</a></h3><p>Eh, not great. But it has some big names, so I had to watch it.  RIP Paul Walker</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind/' target='_blank'>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></h3><p>Lost for words. A near-perfect science-fiction epic that set the tone for so many followers. A flawless performance from Dreyfuss in his signature crazy style. Stunningly shot, marvelously written. Well done. This has been on my watchlist forever and Im glad I finally took the time to take in this masterpiece.</p>
