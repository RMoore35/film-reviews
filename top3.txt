<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/syriana/' target='_blank'>Syriana</a></h3><p>At times a thoughtful analysis, unfortunately this film falls flat like so many before it in. Perhaps this topic isnt fit for a feature length film? But it doesnt matter - movie studios worldwide will continue to exploit the topic for a quick buck.</p>

Annette Bening... OK, I have to crush. How? Im honestly not sure how she can be so good. She is going to have to be my next top-10 list. Now that Im past that, hm. Yes? Yes, I think this is great. Probably beyond great. Not sure I can squeeze it all into one review but Ill try. This starts with the appearance of a classic coming of age tale, that turns into so much more. First, I love the imagery. The house being remodeled is genius, the era choice is brilliant, and the soundtrack fits in nearly every scene. The story often feels stunted and disjointed, but that is one of the deliberate choices that makes this work so well. Fanning and Gerwig as "moms" is a choice that weaves intricately into the beautiful mosaic crafted by everyone involved. (cont.)...</p>

But then, about every 10 minutes, there was another cringy moment.  J.K. Simmons isnt at his best, Snow seems to be on again, off again, and Adam Scott, who should bring excellence, just flat out misses the mark so many times. But, add the decent soundtrack, gentle arc, and some good visuals, and you get a 3-star review.</p>
