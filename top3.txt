Annette Bening... OK, I have to crush. How? Im honestly not sure how she can be so good. She is going to have to be my next top-10 list. Now that Im past that, hm. Yes? Yes, I think this is great. Probably beyond great. Not sure I can squeeze it all into one review but Ill try. This starts with the appearance of a classic coming of age tale, that turns into so much more. First, I love the imagery. The house being remodeled is genius, the era choice is brilliant, and the soundtrack fits in nearly every scene. The story often feels stunted and disjointed, but that is one of the deliberate choices that makes this work so well. Fanning and Gerwig as "moms" is a choice that weaves intricately into the beautiful mosaic crafted by everyone involved. (cont.)...</p>

But then, about every 10 minutes, there was another cringy moment.  J.K. Simmons isnt at his best, Snow seems to be on again, off again, and Adam Scott, who should bring excellence, just flat out misses the mark so many times. But, add the decent soundtrack, gentle arc, and some good visuals, and you get a 3-star review.</p>

I dont think I have seen many of the screen adaptations of Grishams novels. Id have to look back. This one is somewhere around middle of the road. The story is compelling, as is almost guaranteed by a film based on Grishams work. But beyond that, we dont see much of anything special. Both Roberts and Washington have had much stronger performances. And the shady figures who follow them around the whole film are, what, overdone? Even Sam Shepard and Stanley Tucci, who have minor roles in the first half, are too subtle, and not in a good way.  Maybe I should read the book? I need to do something to get over this let-down.</p>
