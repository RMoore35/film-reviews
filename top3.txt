<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/venom-let-there-be-carnage/' target='_blank'>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</a></h3><p>Not that good. Felt rushed, lackadaisical, and phony. Come on, Thomas Hardy. Dont let me down.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/bruised-2021/' target='_blank'>Bruised</a></h3><p>A nice idea with pretty poor execution. Not sure why Halle Berry couldnt make this work.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/stillwater-2021/' target='_blank'>Stillwater</a></h3><p>When you see the cover art and think that Matt Damon kills someone and throws them in the water but then you watch it and are unimpressed with his fake accent.</p>
