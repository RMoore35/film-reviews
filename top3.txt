<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-meyerowitz-stories-new-and-selected/' target='_blank'>The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)</a></h3><p>A bit of an oddball, always good as a quarantine watch. I love the writing and the ensemble cast really helps bring it all together. A strong early appearance from Grace Van Patten. Great.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-hollars/' target='_blank'>The Hollars</a></h3><p>Surprisingly witty, charming, and yes, heart-wrenching. Nearly cried multiple times. And yes, Im proud to admit that. Well done Director John Krasinski.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/city-of-lies/' target='_blank'>City of Lies</a></h3><p>Bit of a waste of talent if you ask me.</p>
