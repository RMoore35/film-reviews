<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/jeepers-creepers/' target='_blank'>Jeepers Creepers</a></h3><p>Just OK. Justin Long is his usual quirky, excellent self. Gina Philips plays the sometimes right, sometimes wrong older sister. Wont be watching the other ones...</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-lucky-ones/' target='_blank'>The Lucky Ones</a></h3><p>No. Hardly anything works here. Even the heart-warming story itself is riddled with poor writing and lack of any sort of clarity.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/touched-by-the-hand-of-god/' target='_blank'>Touched by the Hand of God</a></h3><p>Gotta love the backstory, New Order, Bill Paxton, and Kathryn Bigelow. Cheers!</p>
