<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/better-living-through-chemistry/' target='_blank'>Better Living Through Chemistry</a></h3><p>This review may contain spoilers. A nice little comedy with Sam Rockwell and Michelle Monaghan playing opposite each other as a struggling married couple. Olivia Wilde enters and Bam!, Sam Rockwell all of the sudden turns into a man, wins a bike race, tries to kill Ray Liotta, and wakes up drunk, then stares at Jane Fonda with bleary eyes and tells her he can solve all of her problems.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/happiness/' target='_blank'>Happiness</a></h3><p>Simply too hard to watch due to the subject matter. But... it is clearly an excellent film, I just cant recommend anyone watch it. Enter at your own risk.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/palo-alto/' target='_blank'>Palo Alto</a></h3><p>Jack Kilmer makes a decent debut in this otherwise unimpressive coming-of-age film. Unfortunately, this film follows almost word-for-word many films before it. The few unique elements are quirky and fail to match the style and writing of the rest.  And, this was based on a short story collection by James Franco. Enough said.</p>
