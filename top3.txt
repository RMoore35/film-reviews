<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/last-vegas/' target='_blank'>Last Vegas</a></h3><p>big on names - short on laughs</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/extraction-2015/' target='_blank'>Extraction</a></h3><p>Besides being one of the worst action films I have ever had the displeasure of viewing, can we please stop putting Dan Bilzerians name in the opening credits for nothing roles? Instant devaluing of a film by bringing in a nobody who epitomizes lazy film-making and is a wannabe playboy who probably wasnt held by his mother enough growing up.</p>
