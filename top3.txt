<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/american-history-x/' target='_blank'>American History X</a></h3><p>Despite having a somewhat weak cast, this is an incredibly poignant drama of one mans struggle to live a new life. Probably too violent and close-to-home for some.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/godzilla-vs-kong/' target='_blank'>Godzilla vs. Kong</a></h3><p>The worst part about this? Alexander Skarsg√•rd delivering a career-low performance, over-acting (or maybe being over-directed??) nearly every single line.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-bone-collector/' target='_blank'>The Bone Collector</a></h3><p>Probably my least favorite Denzel move. Nevertheless, both him and Angelina Jolie deliver a better than average performance in an interesting crime thriller. Nothing else to praise here.</p>
