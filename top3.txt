I am almost disgusted because this could have been an excellent film that also brought an incredible story to a wide audience in a compelling way. Instead, it did neither. Decent performances by Br√ºhl and Vikander are about all that brought this up to a star and a half. Oh, and I very much dislike Benedict Cumberbatch. In everything.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/hot-summer-nights/' target='_blank'>Hot Summer Nights</a></h3><p>Chalamet and Cohen are excellent in this. And one of my favs, Maika Monroe, makes a non-horror appearance and delivers a fine performance.  This was a more than decent entry in the coming-of-age genre, with clear nods to The Sandlot and others. Excellent.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/sweetheart-2019/' target='_blank'>Sweetheart</a></h3><p>Wait, wasnt she in flatliners and Neighbors 2?  This must suck then? Nah, not as much as those. This was just kinda middle of the road though. I really wanted to like it since Kiersey Clemons did a phenomenal job and with a few writing/cinematic tweaks, this would have been ever better.  Emory Cohen rounded out what falls somewhere in the middle of the rankings.</p>
