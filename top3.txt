<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-firm-1993/' target='_blank'>The Firm</a></h3><p>Gripping adaptation. Good enough for 3.5 stars.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/paper-towns/' target='_blank'>Paper Towns</a></h3><p>One of the worst coming of age films Ive ever seen. Every line was forced; every shot was ill-conceived and disastrous.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/little-woods/' target='_blank'>Little Woods</a></h3><p>As much as I loved this gripping, powerhouse of a story, I couldnt help but shake the feeling that Lily and Tessa were held back. Bad direction? Bad writing? I suspect the latter. Dont cage the birds. Let them fly free.</p>
