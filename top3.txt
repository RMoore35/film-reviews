<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/about-cherry/' target='_blank'>About Cherry</a></h3><p>An OK script that is marred by bad acting and completely lackluster camera work. I feel like I need to blame James Franco yet again. Yes, I think I will. "It is entirely James Francos fault that this movie sucks."</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/philadelphia/' target='_blank'>Philadelphia</a></h3><p>Compelling performances by both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. And to think I almost didnt watch this because the poster doesnt look like Hanks...</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/garden-state/' target='_blank'>Garden State</a></h3><p>Finally a Natalie Portman and Zach Braff performance I can get behind!</p>
