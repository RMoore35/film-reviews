<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/unhinged-2020/' target='_blank'>Unhinged</a></h3><p>A good cast, including some relatively new actors, lead this edge-of-your-seat thriller about, you guessed it, a man unhinged. Unfortunately, after the first "unhinged" act, this is one of the most predictable films Ive ever watched.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/30-days-of-night/' target='_blank'>30 Days of Night</a></h3><p>Eh, its OK.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-hunt-2012/' target='_blank'>The Hunt</a></h3><p>Viewers beware: this is not an easy or light watch. Mads Mikkelsen absolutely kills it as a somewhat lonely single man, who suddenly finds love and welcomes his son to live with him.  Thats all Ill reveal in the review, no spoilers here. But again, this isnt a light film, nor should it be. This tackles the subject matter with the poise it deserves, with stunning performances from Mads as well as the entire supporting cast. The script and cinematography lend themselves perfectly to the task at hand, delivering a well-crafted portrayal of love, friendship, and ruin.  Excellent.</p>
