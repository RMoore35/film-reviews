<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/boss-level/' target='_blank'>Boss Level</a></h3><p>Well, here we are. Two "Groundhog Day"s in 2020. What a fitting year to have both this and Palm Springs premier in, huh? I would take Palm Springs over this though. Boss Level tries to be so cute. From the get-go, it tugs at your nostalgic heart strings, and continues that theme throughout, with Frank Grillo spending countless number of deaths getting to know his son. Cheers to that. Mel Gibson plays the "Im just trying to save the world!" villain, flanked by a handful of assassins making sure Grillo doesnt make it too far in life. The stereotypes and tropes in this are just too much to ignore. Intentionally? Regardless, this is a decent entry with strong directing and a capable cast. And Naomi Watts brings excellence, of course. So, 3.5 stars.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/how-to-be-alone-2019/' target='_blank'>How to Be Alone</a></h3><p>A troubled Maika Monroe graces us with her presence in this mostly OK short. I say mostly OK because Im just not a fan of the voiceover in the first half. There is something missing that I cant quite put my finger on. Yes, there is the effort to match the on-screen performance, but I dont think the tone is right. Much needed improvement at about the 6 minute mark. Otherwise, this is decent.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/private-life-2018/' target='_blank'>Private Life</a></h3><p>The moment I have been waiting for! Kathryn Hahn in a lead role.  Ever since watching her play the quirky sister in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, I have been waiting for this precise film. There is too much to praise here.  First, there is the always excellent Paul Giamatti. Dont really need to say anything more than that. He plays a a distraught but caring husband, trying to navigate this messy season, better than anyone and makes it look easy. Kathryn Hahn likewise brings incredible energy and realness to a woman that desperately wants to have a kid but more than that, wants life.  Kayli Carter, in what I consider her breakout role, is brilliant and unstoppable as the niece struggling to find her place in the world. Subsequently, shes ready to do anything for people she loves. Last but not least, Tamara Jenkins. You can literally see her in this film. I was in awe and laughter throughout the runtime, often at the same time. Incredible. There were so many scenes in this to praise its hard to keep track. From preparing the house for the adoption agency to waiting - not once, but twice - for the surrogate that never shows up. Everything is intentional and brilliant. Well done. (cont.)...</p>
