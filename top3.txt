<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/heist/' target='_blank'>Heist</a></h3><p>"Tell you what, why dont we cut the nonsense, for old time sake, and say what it is." A tense crime drama thats main strike is an over-reliance on those that came before it. Nevertheless, great acting from all stars, decent writing, and the twists and turns of the plot kept me engaged from start to finish.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/dog-skin/' target='_blank'>Dog Skin</a></h3><p>I believe this is the first horror-short I have ever watched. And it is a decent one. Being based on a fable is a decent starting point for a short-form work like this. I was drawn into the themes and the acting. But, the visuals need work. I look forward to seeing more from Tiago Teixeira.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/syriana/' target='_blank'>Syriana</a></h3><p>At times a thoughtful analysis, unfortunately this film falls flat like so many before it in. Perhaps this topic isnt fit for a feature length film? But it doesnt matter - movie studios worldwide will continue to exploit the topic for a quick buck.</p>
