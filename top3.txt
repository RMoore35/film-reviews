<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/charlies-angels/' target='_blank'>Charlie's Angels</a></h3><p>This has fans and detractors. For good reason. Where to begin... Well, for starters, the cast is so severely underutilized that it makes you question what was going through both the writers and directors heads. There is serious power here, particularly in terms of the actresses. But nearly every time I blinked, I was unimpressed with the dialogue and what I can only imagine was bad directorial decisions. This is supposed to be campy. I get it. But this is just something else entirely and its not good.  This will be towards the bottom of the list of my Sam Rockwell films. And when I make a list for the other stars, it will towards the bottom of their lists as well.  This isnt directly any of their faults, however. You see glimpses throughout of great acting. But as soon as you see it, the camera pans, a campy charade ensues, or Crispin Glover (who hasnt appeared to have aged since "2015") blocks the shot. Or, all of those things happen at once. The end result? A mess.</p>

A tense crime drama thats main strike is an over-reliance on those that came before it. Nevertheless, great acting from all stars, decent writing, and the twists and turns of the plot kept me engaged from start to finish.</p>

Being based on a fable is a decent starting point for a short-form work like this. I was drawn into the themes and the acting. But, the visuals need work. I look forward to seeing more from Tiago Teixeira.</p>
