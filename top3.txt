<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/kill-list/' target='_blank'>Kill List</a></h3><p>A bit tough to understand on the first watch, yet gripping and a compelling portrayal of inner demons. But seriously, are the British the only film-makers who can make a decent crime/thriller film??</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/detour-2016/' target='_blank'>Detour</a></h3><p>An overly-stylized, poorly written crime thriller. It really hurt me to see Emory Cohen in this, but everyone makes mistakes.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-losers/' target='_blank'>The Losers</a></h3><p>Maybe if Chris Evans played himself more - an arrogant, pretentious, nerdy, minor-role douche - he could play a better arrogant, pretentious, nerdy, minor-role douche. This sucks.</p>
