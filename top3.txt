<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/flight/' target='_blank'>Flight</a></h3><p>With Robert Zemekis at the helm, it has to be good, right?  Pretty much. Not the strongest performance by Cheadle, but otherwise the cast is great. John Goodman is a welcome surprise half-way through and really brings this home.  With a feel good ending, what more do you 1-3 star people want?? Its Denzel!!</p>
