<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/pretty-woman/' target='_blank'>Pretty Woman</a></h3><p>"You and I are such similar creatures, Vivian. We both screw people for money." Richard Gere has always played a rich snob really well but I cant help shake the feeling that Julia Roberts was shockingly miscast in this role. She does well but the role just doesnt fit. Oh well, cant win them all.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/american-history-x/' target='_blank'>American History X</a></h3><p>Despite having a somewhat weak cast, this is an incredibly poignant drama of one mans struggle to live a new life. Probably too violent and close-to-home for some.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/godzilla-vs-kong/' target='_blank'>Godzilla vs. Kong</a></h3><p>The worst part about this? Alexander Skarsg√•rd delivering a career-low performance, over-acting (or maybe being over-directed??) nearly every single line.</p>
