<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/sputnik-2020/' target='_blank'>Sputnik</a></h3><p>Wow. There is a lot to praise here.  The cinematography, score, and writing are all excellent. The acting is very strong, from Oksana Akinshina (who hasnt changed a bit since playing a minor but important role in The Bourne Supremacy) to Pyotr Fyodorov, nearly the entire cast is excellent. 4 out of 5 mainly because I have no benchmark. Hope to see more excellent films like this from Russian in the next few years.</p>
