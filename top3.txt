<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-bone-collector/' target='_blank'>The Bone Collector</a></h3><p>Probably my least favorite Denzel move.

<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/unhinged-2020/' target='_blank'>Unhinged</a></h3><p>A good cast, including some relatively new actors, lead this edge-of-your-seat thriller about, you guessed it, a man unhinged. Unfortunately, after the first "unhinged" act, this is one of the most predictable films Ive ever watched.</p>
