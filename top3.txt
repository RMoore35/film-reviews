<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/11-14/' target='_blank'>11:14</a></h3><p>This nice thriller/black comedy brings quite a cast and a fresh take on flashback pieces that have rarely been done well. The often quirky dialogue, cringey happenings, and general good acting held strong throughout the film. Despite seeing a lot of these same elements before, Marcks brought a fresh take that was well thought out and meticulously directed. Nice Saturday evening watch.</p>
