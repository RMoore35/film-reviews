<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/blue-steel-1990/' target='_blank'>Blue Steel</a></h3><p>This review may contain spoilers. OK, lets try a little bit of a longer form review here: Jamie Lee Curtis: yes. One of the original Bad Asses. Have loved her in all of the Halloween films, and not sure why she hasnt done more films recently. By choice? Or has she had trouble getting roles? I dont know and I only really care if she hasnt been cast. If its her choice, good on her. Blue Steel was filmed before Heat. Now that I have seen this, I feel like I can appreciate both of them even more.  This was directed by Kathryn Bigelow, so I have to give praise there. Blue Steel starts off with Curtis catching a burglar in the act (Tom Sizemore, who I loved in Heat) and having to shoot him when he levels his gun at her. Curtis then empties all six rounds of her revolver into him, while noting that his gun is a .44 magnum. Just go with it. Its a bit of a stretch that none of the witnesses remember him having a gun (which couldnt be found because some psycho grabbed it) but whatever Ill role with it since it fits the story. The rest of the movie is essentially the psycho praying on Curtis. The psycho by the way is played by Ron Silver and pretty phenomenally at that. Curtis partner is Clancy Brown, of The Shawshank Redemption fame, who played a decent supporting role in this. I didnt really like how quickly Brown started to believe her. If it took so little convincing, why didnt he just believe her in the beginning?</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/made/' target='_blank'>Made</a></h3><p>A Swingers wanna be. Unnecessary film in my mind. I dont think anyone had their greatest performance here.  Like the low-budget comedy gangster film that it is, this can be kept on the shelf, or discarded whenever you so desire.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-witch-2015/' target='_blank'>The Witch</a></h3><p>Despite how much I dislike period pieces, I have to give this a good review.  Anya Taylor-Joy is phenomenal, along with the rest of the cast. Story is excellent and cinematography is near perfect.</p>
