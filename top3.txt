<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/mr-mrs-smith-2005/' target='_blank'>Mr. & Mrs. Smith</a></h3><p>Average performances, average script. What did you expect?</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/greenland/' target='_blank'>Greenland</a></h3><p>Cue the epic music... and exactly the same elements, acting, cinematography, and script that are in nearly every disaster movie in the last 20 years.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/pretty-woman/' target='_blank'>Pretty Woman</a></h3><p>"You and I are such similar creatures, Vivian. We both screw people for money." Richard Gere has always played a rich snob really well but I cant help shake the feeling that Julia Roberts was shockingly miscast in this role. She does well but the role just doesnt fit. Oh well, cant win them all.</p>
