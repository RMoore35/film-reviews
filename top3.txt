And one of my favs, Maika Monroe, makes a non-horror appearance and delivers a fine performance.  This was a more than decent entry in the coming-of-age genre, with clear nods to The Sandlot and others. Excellent.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/sweetheart-2019/' target='_blank'>Sweetheart</a></h3><p>Wait, wasnt she in flatliners and Neighbors 2?  This must suck then? Nah, not as much as those. This was just kinda middle of the road though. I really wanted to like it since Kiersey Clemons did a phenomenal job and with a few writing/cinematic tweaks, this would have been ever better.  Emory Cohen rounded out what falls somewhere in the middle of the rankings.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/xenogenesis/' target='_blank'>Xenogenesis</a></h3><p>Far from a great work but nevertheless, it is cool to see the beginning of James Camerons style and the effort he put into his first work. Humble beginnings.</p>
