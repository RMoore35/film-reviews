<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/texas-killing-fields/' target='_blank'>Texas Killing Fields</a></h3><p>Im seeing a little more in this than the reviews indicate. First, ChloÃ« Grace Moretz has another great role and Ill have to make a favorite films list for her soon. Sam Worthington is about standard fare - on-again, off-agin. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is about the same, although he seems to bring much better energy than Worthington. Jessica Chastain overdoes it frequently. Unfortunately, I think this is becoming a trend for her (re: Zero Dark Thirty). I love the grit and the tenacity, just doesnt seem to fit all the time.  Yes, this is hard to watch. I get it. But thats not a reason to rank this low. And Ill stand by that.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/f-k/' target='_blank'>F--k</a></h3><p>I thought this was a delightful little short. There was a ton of blending here and the acting was superb for being squeezed into such a short amount of time. A bit too much of "The Bourne Ultimatum" camera work, but it seemed to fit.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-escape-2016/' target='_blank'>The Escape</a></h3><p>A nice little short. This BMW Films short packs a lot into a small amount of time. With serious star power, I couldnt help but think that this could have been so much more than just an expensive, extended, BMW commercial. But, the acting held some weight, and this turned out OK in the end.</p>
