  <h1>Latest Reviews</h1>
  <p><h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/parasite-2019/' target='_blank'>Parasite</a></h3><p>Its been a while since Ive taken the time to do a thorough review. But I suppose a proper film deserves a proper review. Man, oh man. Parasite has been on my radar since it was nominated for numerous Academy Awards (and won four), preceded by becoming the first South Korean film to win the Palme dOr. What will probably be known as Bong Joon-hos masterpiece, Parasite made history, and then some. Characteristic of Bong Joon-hos work, Parasite is a multi-genre work. Dialogue is tense, weighty, and elegant. Yes, those adjectives describe perfectly what is a profound expression of the screenplay. Camera work is tight but slow and wide when needed. Ki-taeks family is unemployed, until they are gifted not just one, but four jobs working for a wealthy family, the Parks. They werent exactly gifted all four jobs, but in a conniving set of maneuvers meant to highlight their social standing, all four members of the family find themselves employed. Two focal points of the film follow: the discovery of the old housekeepers husband living below the house and the unexpected tragedy that befalls the characters on one fateful day on the back lawn. There are too many amazing moments in this film to just focus on one. However, the guiding symbol of the "lucky" rock throughout is breathtaking. Literally breathtaking. First introduced in a nonchalant way, as simply a good-luck charm, the real meaning of the rock is left to the viewer. Does is symbolize the enduring nature of the class system? Perhaps a link to previous works of Joon-hos? Or maybe, the real purpose of the rock is to distract from something deeper in the film. Something more purposeful, bold, and dare I say it, scary? Scary to everyone who feels like their life is so hard, when in reality, they dont have the faintest clue that if they are watching this, they probably live better than 95% of the world.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/paradise-2013/' target='_blank'>Paradise</a></h3><p>I have no clue what I just watched...</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/dune-2021/' target='_blank'>Dune</a></h3><p>Meets the expectations. Every scene nearly perfect. Every line masterfully delivered by a great cast. I remember watching a TV mini-series growing up and was completely turned off of Dune. Now, Im making a trip to the library, because I have to immerse myself in this world.  Stunning.</p>
