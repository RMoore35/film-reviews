    <h3>How interest-based social media is a healthier option</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
      <p>This is my second post on this blog. I made this blog so that I could practice
      creating in raw html/css. I have had a ton of fun so far and I'm looking forward to more
      in the future.</p>
      <p>But on to the good stuff.</p><br>
      <hr><br>
      <p>What?! Social media for film lovers?!</p>
      <p>Sign me up!</p>
      <p>But seriously, what rock have you been living under? Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
      and anyone else in that vain can kindly go away. You are no longer welcome. You have
      made us the product for far too long, and frankly, have ruined a lot of lifes
      on your quest for insane profits and global domination.</p>
      <p>But why interest-based social media?</p>
      <p>Because it's loads more fun. </p>
      <p>But what they heck do I mean by interest based social media?</p>
      <p>Well, the most interesting example to me (mainly because I love it) is <a href="https://letterboxd.com/RMoore35/"
        target="_blank">Letterboxd</a>.</p>
      <p>Letterboxd is not alone. You may also be familiar with <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank">
      Mastodon</a> and the various instances that people have created. There is a Mastodon instance
      for nearly every interest out there. If you believe it, like it, or want it, you can find it.</p>
      <p>Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others have simply become too big. They are overwhelmingly
      negavite, harvest your data, and honestly, the good these companies provide
      is now far outweighed by the negative aspects.</p>
      <p>These companies have gotten so big and they just can't monitor their services
      to provide a effective, healthy conversation. And maybe, just maybe, we just weren't meant to
      be on these massive social media platforms.</p>
      <p>So why not just get off all social media?</p>
      <p>The answer is clear: the right kinds of social media provide much needed connection
      and growth in an increasingly insular world. This is now more important than ever, as most
      of the world has been sitting inside for over a year.</p>
      <p>Interest-based social media is just like it sounds. And that's key. At it's core, interest-based
      social media is just a natural extension of what we have already been doing for thousands
      of years: getting involved with like-minded people and living life together.</p>
      <p>And this is the reason the larger social media companies just don't work. There is
      nothing in the real world analagous to twitter. Rarely in life are you going to find
      a space where you can yell at someone, curse at them, and have generally bad takes
      without real consequences. It's just not real life.</p>
      <p>That's why I am on interest-based social media. I want to find like-minded people
      that can help me grow, where I can learn about new topics in-detail, and where I can
      ask real questions and get real answers. The big social media companies don't offer that
      and frankly, probably never will. Why? It's not in their business interests. And
      since most of them make a ton of money as public companies, it will remain this
      way for as long as forseeably possible.</p>
      <p>So what's the call to action?</p>
      <p>Find a group. I mentioned Letterboxd above (which is not necessarily a traditional
      interest-based social media) but definitely check out Mastodon. Just a quick
      web search can reveal exactly what you are looking for. Check it out!</p>
      <p>Cheers!</p>
