    <h1>The Batman - Raw Review</h1>
    <h3>Some raw, unedited thoughts on The Batman. Seriously, unedited.</h3>
    <h3>March 8th, 2021</h3>
    <p>This is my third post on this blog. I made this blog so that I could practice
    creating in raw html/css. I have had a ton of fun so far and I'm looking forward to more
    in the future.</p>
    <p>But on to the good stuff.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>Watched 5/4 and again 5/8</p>
    <br>
    <p>Immediately stylized as a detective/crime film. Mysterious.</p>
    <p>Psychotic attack. Cold camera work. Slow pace for full effect.</p>
    <p>Dark. Stormy. Homeage to previous Batman's but with its own style.</p>
    <p>From cold to over-stimulated. A city in chaos. Strange masks - bizarreness.</p>
    <p>The monologue is risky, given the feelings toward a less "gruff" batman.</p>
    <p>The audible footsteps is an interesting touch. A bit of a horror element a bit
      of foreshadowing to the bat signal. </p>
    <p>Fight style seems filled with rage. Restlessness. Remorse.</p>
    <p>Costume is more handmade. Leathery. Scraped together.</p>
    <p>More detective elements. Batman "welcomed" in. Serious departure from previous.</p>
    <p>Soundtrack excellently prepares us for the unmasking.</p>
    <p>Streetbike. Again, pieced together. Budget. Broken.</p>
    <p>Combination of high-tech and hand-written notes allude more to complicated Batman.
    Thin. Worn out. Tired.</p>
    <p>First meet has enough sexual tension to satisfy but not too much. Matches style
    and pace well.</p>
    <p>First laugh - "You've got a lot of cats." Nearly 42 minutes in. Excellent pace.</p>
    <p>Finally, we get to see a bit behind the curtain. The Riddler gives some clues
    to his past and personality.</p>
    <p>1:14 we finally get to see some of the fabled Batman invicibility. Shortest epic
    wingsuit scene I've ever seen.</p>
    <p>Batmobile is more like a demolition derby car with a jet engine than anything
    seen before. Amazing.</p>
    <p>Great chase scene with well-executed soundtrack timing. Enough silence to let the actors
    and cars work.</p>
    <p>Again, just brilliant writing and pacing. Slows down just enough to let you catch up
    and breath, before dunking you under again.</p>
    <p>Yes!!! That scene with the muzzle flashes as lighting. Hell yes!</p>
    <p>Paul Dano makes his "appearance", and it could not be more perfect. Channeling everything
    he has. Incredible.</p>
    <p>Does he know? Mystery.</p>
    <p>The humanization of The Riddler through both the orphan story and the final video
    release is brilliant. "Thanks for the tips on detonators". I wanted to laugh.</p>
    <p>Enjoyed the final expose. And excited for what is next.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Overall thoughts: stunning, brilliantly directed, well acted. All around great film.</p>
