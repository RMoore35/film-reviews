    <h3>The Film World in 2021</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="main" style="margin:25px 300px 25px 300px;">
      <p>This is my first post on this blog. I made this blog so that I could practice
      creating in raw html/css. I have had a ton of fun so far and I'm looking forward to more
      in the future.</p>
      <p>But on to the good stuff.</p><br>

      <p>What the heck is going on with films in 2021?!</p>
      <p>The better question is, what went on in 2020? Because that's really where it started.</p>
      <p>In 2020, we had everything from missed openings to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/12/tom-cruise-yells-at-film-crew-for-breaking-covid-19-rules.html"
        target="_blank">Tom Cruise yelling at the Film Crew</a> for not adhering to protocols.</p>
      <p>So what to make of all this?</p>
      <p>Well, first of all, we know the film world is changing. Streaming services have continued
      to show strongly at awards shows and we all know that festivals and in-person viewings are,
      for the most part, not happening.</p>
      <p>So what to do?</p>
      <p>Well, for me, I have loved getting involved with the <a href="https://letterboxd.com/RMoore35/"
        target="_blank">Letterboxd</a> community. Letterboxd isn't your average social
      media nor is it just a review site. It's a little bit of both. Plus, I love
      that they pull from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank">The Movie Database</a>
       instead of IMDb, which is owned by the evil Amazon.</p>
      <p>I have also been getting into shorts. If you are like me, you have found some weird
      changes to your attention span. This is OK! I think COVID has had some very far-reaching
      long-term consequences, some of which we don't yet fully understand. Embrace them
      the best you can. And if you need help, please please <a href="
      https://www.mentalhealth.gov/get-help/immediate-help" target="_blank">reach out to someone.</a></p>
      <p>OK, that's it for this installment. I will try to post something a few times each
      month. I feel like I am a little behind the times with just now getting into long-form
      blogging.</p>
      <p>But whatever. I like it.</p>
      <p>Cheers!</p>
