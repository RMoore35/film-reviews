      <h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/made/' target='_blank'>Made</a></h3><p>A Swingers wanna be. Unnecessary film in my mind. I dont think anyone had their greatest performance here.  Like the low-budget comedy gangster film that it is, this can be kept on the shelf, or discarded whenever you so desire.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/the-witch-2015/' target='_blank'>The Witch</a></h3><p>Despite how much I dislike period pieces, I have to give this a good review.  Anya Taylor-Joy is phenomenal, along with the rest of the cast. Story is excellent and cinematography is near perfect.</p>
<h3><a href='https://letterboxd.com/rmoore35/film/earthquake-bird/' target='_blank'>Earthquake Bird</a></h3><p>I honestly thought this was excellent. I dont agree with the mixed reviews that tend to lean negative.  Vikander was phenomenal, as usual. The visuals were stunning and the story was captivating.  The only thing I will say is maybe some of the supporting roles were incorrectly casted? I dont know. I dont see the negative. Maybe I am too blinded by my never-ending praise for Vikander.</p>
