# film-reviews
A site that I created from scratch to write about all things film.

This site is a personal project. I wrote it in HTML/CSS first before I transferred the HTML into PHP to add some functionality. This site
will now update my reviews and favorite actresses/actors based on my Letterboxd profile.

I use a python script to parse through my Letterboxd profile RSS feed but hopefully I can update this in the future to be fully PHP.

I welcome any feedback on this project. I had a lot of fun with it and I look forward to more projects like it in the future.

** As of March 2nd, 2021, this site is now hosted on Netlify at: https://nervous-raman-bfd69b.netlify.app/index.html

Please forgive the auto-generated url. Hopefully I can host this with a more descript domain name in the future.
